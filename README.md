# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.  Out of 50 possible datasets, I have chosen video games to conduct the study.


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

![summary table](https://github.com/cortesh/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Final2_tbl.jpg)

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?


## Summary: 

In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
